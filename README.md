# Data Structures
To brush up on data structures, I have decided to implement at least some of them from scratch.

This is mainly an exercise for me, but someone may be able to learn from my code, so I've published it here.

These are trivial implementations, and should not be used in any code that matters to you at all. My code may make a good starting point to implement your own, but
these structures are builtin to a lot of languages, so I still wouldn't recommend it.

At the moment, I'm implementing these in Java and Kotlin, but I will probably add more languages down the road. I do enjoy writing random code in random languages.
